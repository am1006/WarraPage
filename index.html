            <p>Hey everyone,</p>
            <p>I hope this email finds you’ll well and in good health.</p>
            <p>As classes start this week which will majorly be online, I know it can be quite overwhelming and scary for the most of us. It’s a whole new experience that everyone is advised to be using and it’s only for the best.</p>
            <p>From the bottom of my heart I wish and pray for this whole situation to pass, but during this time let’s come together and support each other. We are here for you guys and no matter what, we will do the best in our knowledge to help you’ll with it. </p>
            <p>There are a few great ideas coming up by our SR’s coming up in a weeks time and if you guys have any ideas that you’ll want us to organize or help do let us know.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, stay indoors, stay safe and try to enjoy this time with your hobbies, staying in touch with family and most importantly loving yourself and staying positive and healthy ! </p>
            <p>Love,</p>
            <p>Neerisha</p>
